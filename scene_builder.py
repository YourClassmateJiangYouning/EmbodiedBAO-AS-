"""Apply one of the Stage 3 scenes to a live USD stage.

The catalogue in ``scenes.py`` says what a scene is; this module puts it on the stage.  It is
written defensively because it cannot be exercised on the development machine -- ``pxr`` only
exists inside Isaac Sim -- so every optional step records what actually happened instead of
assuming it worked.  ``apply_scene`` returns a report, and the runner writes it beside
args.json, which is what makes "this run used the real Concrete_Panels texture" a fact about
the data rather than a claim about the machine.

Three rules it must not break, all enforced in ``test_bao_scenes.py``:

* the marker is the task, so its size, position and centre height come from the catalogue and
  are identical for all 25;
* dressing never collides, so nothing here applies a collider or a rigid body to it;
* nothing here touches the obstacle wall, the opening, the room's bounds or the success
  plane.  Those belong to ``environment.py`` and the scene must leave them exactly as they
  were -- which is what makes the scene a skin rather than a variable.
